Let's face it life isn't easy :(

Things that we love are always way too expensive.
Food that tastes good is never healthy.
Cars that go fast has low milage :(
Wish life was better
It's boring
it is what it is
It's okay not to be okay
But it is always important to strive towards being okay :')
ya may be
